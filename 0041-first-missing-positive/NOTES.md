the first positive numbers starts from 1 so we need to keep the track of 1 first;
we dont need to consider nums[i] having value <=0 and >n;
replacing them with 1 ;
treating nums[i] of i as index and as we reach just marking negative ;
after doing above steps then
traversing the nums  the first positive number is i+1;
